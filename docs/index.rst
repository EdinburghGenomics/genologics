Pyclarity-lims
==============

Pyclarity-lims is a fork of `genologics <https://github.com/SciLifeLab/genologics>`_ that we extended and modified.
Most of the initial logic still applies and genologics module still exist in pyclarity-lims for backward compatibility.
However there are a few backward incompatible changes that had to be made.
